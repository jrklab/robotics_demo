# Robotics Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my robotics projects showcase! This repository contains demonstrations and documentation of various robotics projects I've worked on.

## Projects

### LEAP Hand Project
- **Description**: A sophisticated robotic hand project focusing on dexterous manipulation and human-like grasping capabilities.
- **Technologies Used**:
  - ROS (Robot Operating System)
  - Custom-designed hand mechanisms
  - Advanced motor control systems
  - Computer vision for object detection
  - Machine learning for grasp planning

- **Demo**:
  <!-- Once you upload your media files, we can add them like this: -->
  <!-- ![LEAP Hand Overview](assets/images/leap-hand-overview.jpg) -->
  <!-- Add video demonstrations: -->
  <!-- - [Grasping Demo](assets/videos/leap-hand-grasping.mp4) -->
  <!-- - [Manipulation Demo](assets/videos/leap-hand-manipulation.mp4) -->
  
  *Media files coming soon*

- **Key Features**:
  - Multiple degrees of freedom for complex manipulation tasks
  - Precise finger control and force feedback
  - Advanced grasping algorithms
  - Real-time control and response system

- **Documentation**: 
  <!-- Add links to detailed documentation when available -->
  *Detailed documentation coming soon*
