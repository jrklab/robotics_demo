# Robotics Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my robotics projects showcase! This repository contains demonstrations and documentation of various robotics projects I've worked on. Most of them are open source projects.

## Projects

### LEAP Hand Project
- **Description**: A sophisticated robotic hand project focusing on dexterous manipulation and human-like grasping capabilities.
